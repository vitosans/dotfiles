#Dotfiles#

These are my dotfiles, nothing cool really, no I mean it ;) 

I have created / collected these over the years from various people who know much more about this stuff then I.
 
Recently I have taken a few ideas from others on github and cobbled this together as a start to my own githosted collection, this will change as I go over these, but this is a good base for now.
