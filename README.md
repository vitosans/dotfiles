# DOTFILES

>These are my dotfiles, nothing cool really, no I mean it ;) 

I have created / collected these over the years from various people who know much more about this stuff then I.
 
Recently I started to recreate these as my roles change. 

## More info

* **bash_exports** These are all the exports I need.
* **bash_linux** Linux specific tweaks are placed in here.
* **bash_mac** Mac specific tweaks are placed in here.
* **bash_profile** This just sources your ~/.bashrc
* **bash_prompt** Used to configure the look and feel of the bash prompt
* **bash_rc** Configures bash / based on your OS as setup prompt 
* **dir_colors** Directory and file defines for bash (now that Lion Supports it)
